# big-finder
Find your big - 100% potential satisfaction guaranteed!

Please install python 3.7.9 on your device: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/

If you already have python3 installed, perhaps you don't need to.
However - make sure that pip is installed as well: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

In the same directory as the file (using cmd for windows, terminal for Mac, etc), run **python3 big_finder.py**

big_finder.py is in byte-code form. Don't worry, it's not malicious - this is my public account, after all. Just like you, I'm not looking to get expelled :)
